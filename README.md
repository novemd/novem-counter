Novem Counter - WordPress Plugin
================================

About
-----
Novem Counter is a *very* simple WordPress plugin that allows you to animate a count up from 0 to the number in the shortcode.

This plugin was initially written by Novem Designs, LLC [link](http://www.novemwebdesign.com) for use in a client project. Because it was based on code found elsewhere, I offer it up so others may expand on it.

To Use
------
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. ZIP the `novem-counter` direcotry.
3. Upload the zip file to your WordPress website.
